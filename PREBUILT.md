# Prebuilt Keyboards

- [Prebuilt Keyboards](#prebuilt-keyboards)
  - [Non-standard bottom row layouts](#non-standard-bottom-row-layouts)

Believe it or not, you may not require something as robust as whatever build that some Keyboard YouTuber is showing off with a $700 price tag in the preview thumbnail! A healthy mindset recognizes that a keyboard is a tool, and either your tool works for you, or works against you; a good prebuilt board will work for you, and get everything you need without getting in your way.
Things to keep in mind:

- The Good Brands
  - Some brands are preferred by the MechKeys server than others. Leopold is known to have binned (cherry-picked) Cherry MX switches. Them, Varmilo and Keychron are known to apply some grease on their stabilizer wires to prevent stabilizer rattle. ABKO makes tanks, and so on.
- Plate mounted stabilizer limitations
  - Most prebuilts have their PCBs wave-soldered together, which is a process too hot for most PCB mounted stabilizers to survive; hence, most prebuilts are built with plate mount stabilizers. They will generally be unable to be upgraded with other PCB mount stabilizers.
- Factory lube on stabilizers
  - Some gamery prebuilts will probably lack this, since stabilizer wire rattle is part of the fun! Other manufacturers (Leopold, Varmilo, Keychron) will have some sort of grease applied to the stabilizer wires on your boards and reduce rattle. If you don’t intend on injecting your stabilizer housings with Superlube, this is nice to have!
- Non-Standard Bottom row layouts (ex. 6.5u spacebar on some Corsair layouts)
  - Non-standard bottom row layouts can make finding compatible keysets between a little tricky (ex. Womier K66) to nightmarish (Corsair K70).
- Non-Cherry MX switches
  - Common switch manufacturers you’ll find in prebuilts are Gateron, Kailh, Outemu, and maybe TTC in a few cases. Most are decent and punch above their weight comapred to Cherry cost. Sure, they'll have some amount of scratch and spring ping stock
  - Supposedly HyperX is just rebranded Gateron, Keychron branded switches are just rebranded Huano’s (not great), Logitech’s GL’s are Kailh Chocs, Logitech GX are just Kailh.
  - Omron Romer-G: unpopular switch, tactility is unimpressive
  - More information about the switch manufacturer meta [here](#switches-the-switch-meta)
- Hotswap support is not found on many prebuilts, but when it’s found, it’s nice to have!
  - Kailh hotswap is reasonably good hotswap that can arrive in a prebuilt, and it supports most-all Cherry MX clone switches.
  - Quality of TTC hotswap is unknown, but presumably good.
  - Gateron hotswap provides similar compatibility (most to all Cherry MX clone type switches) as the above two, but the QC seems to be worse, between leaves having a greater tendency to bend the wrong way, or the portion that is soldered to the board snapping off of the plastic socket part. Moreover, the contact leaves have a slightly greater tendency towards getting bent the wrong way, and this may have to do with their reduced reliability vs Kailh hotswap sockets.
  - CIY hotswap is known to have fairly weak contact leaves, to the point where a CIY hotswap socket can hardly retain a switch by the pins like the above hotswap sockets can.
  - Outemu hotswap is a rivet that can be installed onto PCB’s cheaply and easily, but compatibility is much more limited than with Kailh/Gateron/TTC/CIY style sockets. This sort of hotswap is found only on prebuilts.
    - Compatability for other Outemu switches and KTT (includes Akko CS) is known.
    - Huano stuff like Feker Pandas have mixed reports on support.

## Non-standard bottom row layouts

Some bottom row layouts on *some* prebuilts will have strange width spacebars that are less easy to find replacements for than your traditional 6.25u or 7u spacebar.

Note the 6.5u spacebar.
