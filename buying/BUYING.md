# buying stuff

hello.

i'm writing this in tyol 2022. the state of keyboards has changed much since when I first entered the hobby at the opening of pandemic in 2020. gmk sets are stocked plentifully in many different locales, extras are cheap, plastic injection-molded keyboards with PCBs that have switches that face the correct direction are plentiful. boards that complete GB just don't flip as hard as they used to. few things flip as hard as they used to, barring all the things that have flipped their way to a highly inflated price, and are resisting depreciation. buddha from jtk appears to be giving some western GB runners the time of day when it comes to updates. STM32's, STM clones, and recent RP2040 support being added to QMK is freeing us from the grip of atmega pricing, availability, and lack of RAM. in some respects, the hobby has slowed down. 2021 had a peak of as many as 12 GMK sets running within a month; now, we'll tend to see three or four. ePBT has stopped taking sets. designers won't run with keyreative until their whole deal gets back under control (and with recent fulfillment seems to be showing they're making fairly steady process, quality notwithstanding). new boards aren't being run all the time, GB's are beginning to fail to make MOQ. here's my personal theory: the heyday of 2020-2021 was a marked period of exponential growth in the hobby. with new members entering, a new cadre of customers appeared, ready to eat new products, absorb mechmarket flip prices, and absorb older members's liquidation sales so said older members could fund new GB's, along with new members coming in. without continued rapid growth in the hobby, liquidation attempts fail, and the market is effectively too oversaturated with existing product for new product to be developed.

in other words, it's never been better for someone new to get into keyboards. this is where you, the intended reader, come in.

i was one of those suckers who bought in without knowing too much, but having more money than sense, I learned the hard/expensive way about a lot of things. i write this as a guide for you, but also for my past self; i want to document all the knowledge i wish i could give myself two years ago, so that I wouldn't have had to spend my way into knowing better.

## why make a keyboard?

What compels someone to build a custom mechanical keyboard?
Is it to game better? I don't think so. There are other manufacturers what can advertise how their special PCB has super low latency to help you game better at whatever it is you play, and that's not something that kits even consider a point to focus on. QMK has a default poll rate of 1000Hz as of the time this article is being written, and latency is something many people in the hobby don't care too much about. As long as it types, it's fine. Building a keyboard with the expectation you'll get higher performance out of it than some gamer OEM boards is a mistake.

Is it to become more productive at work? That wasn't the case for me; I had a full size Dell membrane that I worked from comfortably and quietly for two years.

Is it more ergonomic? If you're buying a standard kit with the usual amount of stagger and Cherry MX switches, this probably isn't the case. Cherry MX switches are fairly tall, so the keyboard itself will generally be much taller than a lot of common membrane boards. Higher quality ergonomics can be found in boards that are split, have a tenting angle, have different stagger to the keys (search up terms like "ortholinear" or "columnar stagger" for more information)

I think it comes down the joy that people find in putting kits together, kits of model cars, Lego, wooden ships in bottles, and so on. It's fun to make plans for things, it's fun to put things together with your own hands, and it's fun to do it on all your own terms. Having this thing on your desk that you picked out the parts for and customized on your terms can be a personal statement, one that can be something to be proud of with careful and considerate planning.

## picking stuff out

### finding places to buy stuff

writing as someone from canada/US, I really only have experience speaking to what the purchasing experience is like buying from within. i've paid my fair deal of shipping costs, i've paid my fair deal of import tax, and i have survived, and you can too. putting together a custom keyboard is not a low-budget operation (and I assure you that attempting to make it so is going to kneecap you eventually), but here is my general philosophy:
* i would rather pay money to a vendor who is interested in providing a quality product to me than an e-commerce site who will, at best, give me a refund should anything go wrong
* i would rather pay for shipping a few times than pay for the hidden cost of a more convenient crappier product.

at this point, if you want to whinge at me about having to pay for shipping, I have a few closing remarks:
the first keyboard I owned as an adult was the one I picked up from the surplus store at my university. it was free because the people who ran the store were too lazy to ring me up. if they weren't, it would have been $5 USD.
a usable keyboard should cost about 10 USD, maybe 20. You're lining up many more times than that to put together a kit. maybe it's a hundred fifty bucks. maybe it's three hundred. the cost of shipping becoming your hill to die on is something that makes no sense to me when the cost of other factors are figured in. find a vendor based in your country, cheap out on the switches, go to aliexpress (the good people of aliexpress will under-declare your packages to help you avoid import tax).

if you are a child whose parents won't let you buy from anywhere from amazon, I can't help with that. that factor won't make the fact that you're buying a gk64 in tyol 2022 any better. either wait a few years so that you can move out, get a job, and then let life's major responsibilities beat you down into forgetting you ever want a keyboard, or, do what I did, and squirrel away cash until you can buy a prepaid debit card that will allow you to buy things online outside of your parents'/guardians' control.

i've got a small set of possible vendors lined up [here](VENDORS.md). you can also see what's worth grabbing around thocstock, or similar vendor-listing sites like on [keeb.gg](https://keeb.gg).

### the board

#### the case

**plastic is fine, man**

#### the pcb

**if the switches don't face south and I can't compile the firmware myself, I don't want it**

#### the plate

**do not overthink plate material.**

**polycarbonate/pom if you want it deep and thocky wocky and fwexy wexy, aluminum if you're normal, and whatever they give you in a kit if you're extremely normal**

#### the mount style

### keycaps

**don't get a half-assed clone

### switches

**with the right manufacturer, there might not be enough that makes a 66 cent switch worth 41 cents more than a 25 cent switch**

the first switch I really truly enjoyed were gateron yellows. after that, I bought durock alpacas, which were even nicer to use. 


**stick with the classics. polycarbonate and/or nylon housings, and pom stems**

the market for switches continues to grow larger and more complicated. you'll see these sorts of plastics get thrown around housings
* nylon
* polycarbonate
* POM
* 

#### switch modding

** do not cheap out on switch lube **
** if you have to film and you don't know why, pick out foam films. **

#### stabilizers

you have a [few solid options](STABILIZERS.md),
